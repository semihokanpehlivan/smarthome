##### Literature About SmartHome Application or Systems

>	In this part, we will examine the existing smarthome applicaitons that is using at the moment.
Those're the application or system that use the python programming language or raspberry pi mini computer(with python again)

-	I explained the smarthome system that i like until now. The name of it is **SmartHome** by Arcadia Labs in France

###### SmartHome by Arcadia[1]

-	It is knonw as easy to configure and uses the home wireless network using central station and various low-power nodes.
-	SmartHome by Arcadia uses some technologies as follows:
	-	Raspberry pi with custom atmege328 shield
	-	RFM12b wireless transponder 
	-	RTC module
	-	Custom mobile-friendly bootstrap web interface
	-	Software based component that Smarthome uses:
		-	GNU/Linux (Raspbian)
		-	Apache + PHP + MySQL + Twitter Bootstrap
		-	imagemagick + php5-imagick + php5-gd
		-	xplanet
		-	Python + python-uinput + python-smbus + i2c-tools + python-serial + python-psutil + evdev + python-simplejson
		-	wiringPi
		-	ssmtp + mailutils
		-	motion
		-	Arduino IDE + inotool

-	General Raspberry pi computer and its environments

-	Other project about Smarthome is Home Assistant[2]
	-	Home Control is responsible for collecting information on- and controlling devices.
	-	Home Automation triggers commands based on user configurations.
	-	Smart Home triggers commands based on previous behavior.
